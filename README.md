## Overview

**Overview**

The Azure Logic Apps Monitoring solution is a production-ready, cloud-native reference architecture that demonstrates how to build, monitor, and operate event-driven order management workflows on Azure. It combines the orchestration power of **.NET Aspire**, the workflow automation of **Azure Logic Apps Standard**, and enterprise-grade observability through **Application Insights** and **Log Analytics** — all deployed as Infrastructure-as-Code using **Bicep** and **Azure Developer CLI (azd)**.

This solution provides development teams and architects with a fully working end-to-end example of an order management platform: from accepting orders through a REST API and Blazor web frontend, dispatching them via **Azure Service Bus**, processing them with **Logic Apps Standard** workflows, and persisting results to **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Blob Storage**. Every component is monitored with distributed tracing via **OpenTelemetry**, making it observable from development through production.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is structured as an `azd` template. Running `azd up` from a configured Azure environment provisions all infrastructure and deploys all services end-to-end without manual steps.

> [!TIP]
> For local development without Azure services, the solution runs entirely using the **.NET Aspire Developer Dashboard** with an Azure Service Bus emulator. Only an Azure subscription and authenticated CLI session are required for cloud deployment.

## Architecture

**Overview**

The solution follows a layered event-driven architecture with clear separation between the web frontend, backend API, message-driven workflow processing, and shared infrastructure. The **.NET Aspire AppHost** acts as the orchestration entry point for both local development and Azure Container Apps deployment, wiring together service discovery, health checks, and environment-specific configuration automatically.

At the core of the monitoring story, **Azure Logic Apps Standard** workflows consume Service Bus messages, call back into the Orders API, and route the processed payloads to Azure Blob Storage — either to a success container or an error container — depending on the HTTP response code. All I/O, telemetry, and workflow runs are captured in the connected **Application Insights** and **Log Analytics** workspace, giving operators a single pane of glass for the entire solution.

## Requirements

**Overview**

This solution targets Azure cloud deployment using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) workflow with .NET 10 SDK. The complete toolchain is validated by the `check-dev-workstation.ps1` / `check-dev-workstation.sh` scripts included in the `hooks/` directory. **Running these scripts before first deployment** ensures your workstation meets all version thresholds before any Azure resources are provisioned.

For local development, **Docker is required** to run the Azure Service Bus emulator used by Aspire's local mode. For Azure deployment, an **active Azure subscription** with sufficient quota for Container Apps, Logic Apps Standard (WorkflowStandard tier), Azure SQL, and Service Bus is required.

| Prerequisite           | Minimum Version | Purpose                          | Validation Script  |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| ☁️ Azure Subscription  | Active          | ☁️ Cloud resource provisioning   | `az account show`  |
| 🔑 Azure Developer CLI | ≥ 1.11.0        | 🚀 One-command deploy (`azd up`) | `azd version`      |
| 🛠️ Azure CLI           | ≥ 2.60.0        | 🔧 Resource management and auth  | `az version`       |
| ⚡ .NET SDK            | 10.0.100        | ⚡ Build and test                | `dotnet --version` |
| 🔗 Bicep CLI           | ≥ 0.30.0        | 📐 IaC template compilation      | `az bicep version` |
| 🐳 Docker Desktop      | Latest          | 🐋 Local Service Bus emulator    | `docker version`   |
| 🖥️ PowerShell          | ≥ 7.0           | 📜 Hook script execution         | `pwsh --version`   |

> [!WARNING]
> The `global.json` file pins the .NET SDK to version `10.0.100`. Using an older SDK version will cause build failures. Run `dotnet --version` to confirm your installed version and update via the [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) if needed.

## Quick Start

The fastest path from zero to a running deployment is the `azd up` command. The following steps authenticate, configure a new environment, and deploy the complete solution including all Azure infrastructure and application containers.

**1. Clone and authenticate:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evilazaro/Azure-LogicApps-Monitoring.git
cd Azure-LogicApps-Monitoring
azd auth login
```

**2. Validate your workstation:**

```powershell
./hooks/check-dev-workstation.ps1
```

**3. Initialize a new azd environment:**

```bash
azd env new <your-environment-name>
```

**4. Deploy everything:**

```bash
azd up
```

`azd up` runs in this order:

- `preprovision` hook — cleans, restores, builds, and tests the solution
- Bicep IaC — provisions all Azure resources (VNet, identity, SQL, Service Bus, Container Apps, Logic Apps)
- `postprovision` hook — configures SQL managed identity and .NET user secrets for local development
- Application deploy — builds and pushes container images, deploys to Azure Container Apps

> [!TIP]
> To deploy only the application code without re-provisioning infrastructure, run `azd deploy`. To tear down all Azure resources, run `azd down`.

**Expected output after `azd up`:**

```text
SUCCESS: Your up workflow to provision and deploy to Azure completed in 12m.

Outputs:
  AZURE_CONTAINER_APPS_ENVIRONMENT_ID : /subscriptions/.../environmentId
  ORDERS_API_URL                      : https://orders-api.<env>.azurecontainerapps.io
  WEB_APP_URL                         : https://web-app.<env>.azurecontainerapps.io
```

## Deployment

**Full Deployment (Provision + Deploy)**

```bash
# Provision infrastructure and deploy apps in one step
azd up
```

**Infrastructure Only**

```bash
# Provision Azure resources without deploying application containers
azd provision
```

**Application Only (after infrastructure exists)**

```bash
# Build, push images, and deploy to Container Apps
azd deploy
```

**Tear Down**

```bash
# Delete all Azure resources and resource group
azd down
```

**Local Development (without Azure)**

```bash
# Run in local mode with .NET Aspire Developer Dashboard
dotnet run --project app.AppHost
```

Opening `https://localhost:17000` launches the **.NET Aspire Dashboard** showing real-time traces, logs, and resource states for all services.

**Run Tests**

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Debug \
  --results-directory ./src/tests/AzdTestResults \
  --coverage \
  --coverage-output-format cobertura \
  --coverage-output coverage.cobertura.xml
```

## Usage

**Overview**

All API interactions use the base URL of the deployed `orders-api` Container App. The full OpenAPI specification is available at `<orders-api-url>/swagger` once deployed. For local Aspire development, the URL is shown in the **.NET Aspire Dashboard** under the `orders-api` resource entry. Every endpoint emits OpenTelemetry spans tagged with the HTTP method, route, and order ID — all visible in Application Insights.

### Place a Single Order

```http
POST https://<orders-api-url>/api/Orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "order-001",
  "customerId": "customer-123",
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Main Street, Seattle, WA 98101",
  "total": 89.97,
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "op-001",
      "orderId": "order-001",
      "productId": "prod-abc",
      "productDescription": "Wireless Headphones",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 19.99
    },
    {
      "id": "op-002",
      "orderId": "order-001",
      "productId": "prod-xyz",
      "productDescription": "USB-C Hub",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 49.99
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected response (`201 Created`):**

```json
{
  "id": "order-001",
  "customerId": "customer-123",
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Main Street, Seattle, WA 98101",
  "date": "2026-03-06T10:00:00Z",
  "total": 89.97,
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "op-001",
      "orderId": "order-001",
      "productId": "prod-abc",
      "productDescription": "Wireless Headphones",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 19.99
    },
    {
      "id": "op-002",
      "orderId": "order-001",
      "productId": "prod-xyz",
      "productDescription": "USB-C Hub",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 49.99
    }
  ]
}
```

After the order is persisted to Azure SQL, the Orders API publishes a message to the `ordersplaced` Service Bus topic. The **Logic Apps Standard** `OrdersPlacedProcess` workflow triggers on that message, validates the `Content-Type` is `application/json`, calls `POST /api/Orders/process`, and routes the result to either the `ordersprocessedsuccessfully` Blob container (HTTP 201) or the error Blob container (any other code).

### Retrieve All Orders

```http
GET https://<orders-api-url>/api/Orders
```

**Expected response (`200 OK`):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "order-001",
    "customerId": "customer-123",
    "deliveryAddress": "123 Main Street, Seattle, WA 98101",
    "date": "2026-03-06T10:00:00Z",
    "total": 89.97,
    "products": [ ... ]
  }
]
```

### Retrieve a Single Order

```http
GET https://<orders-api-url>/api/Orders/order-001
```

**Expected response (`200 OK`):** Returns the matching `Order` JSON object. Returns `404 Not Found` with `{ "error": "Order with ID order-001 not found", "type": "NotFoundError" }` if not found.

### Delete an Order

```http
DELETE https://<orders-api-url>/api/Orders/order-001
```

**Expected response:** `204 No Content` on success, `404 Not Found` if the order does not exist.

### Place Orders in Batch

For load testing or bulk imports, submit an array of `Order` objects to the batch endpoint:

```http
POST https://<orders-api-url>/api/Orders/batch
Content-Type: application/json

[ { ...order1... }, { ...order2... } ]
```

**Expected response (`200 OK`):** Array of all successfully placed `Order` objects.

### Generating Test Orders

The `Generate-Orders.ps1` script creates realistic randomized order payloads in JSON format, compatible with the batch endpoint and Logic Apps triggers:

```powershell
# Generate 2000 orders with default settings (saves to infra/data/ordersBatch.json)
./hooks/Generate-Orders.ps1

# Generate 100 orders with 2-4 products each to a custom path
./hooks/Generate-Orders.ps1 -OrderCount 100 -MinProducts 2 -MaxProducts 4 -OutputPath "./test-orders.json"

# Dry run to preview actions without writing files
./hooks/Generate-Orders.ps1 -WhatIf
```

### Health Check Endpoints

Both services expose standard health endpoints registered by `.NET Aspire` service defaults:

| Endpoint         | Purpose                             | Expected Response                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 🟢 `GET /health` | 🔍 Deep health check (dependencies) | `200 OK` with health report JSON |
| 💚 `GET /alive`  | ❤️ Liveness probe (process running) | `200 OK` plain text              |

### Browsing the Web App

Navigate to the deployed Web App URL to manage orders through the Blazor Server UI. The frontend is built with **Microsoft FluentUI v4.14.0** and communicates with the Orders API through Aspire service discovery — the `services:orders-api:https:0` key is automatically resolved at startup.

### Monitoring in Azure Portal

All observability data flows into the single Log Analytics workspace provisioned by the Bicep IaC:

| Tool                    | Where to look                                        | What you see                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

## Configuration

**Overview**

All environment-specific configuration is managed through `azd` environment variables and .NET user secrets. The `postprovision.ps1` hook automatically populates user secrets for all three projects (`app.AppHost`, `eShop.Orders.API`, `eShop.Web.App`) after `azd provision` completes — **no manual secret management is required** for standard deployments. For CI/CD pipelines running as a `ServicePrincipal`, the same environment variables are injected automatically from the provisioned Azure resources.

Sensitive values (connection strings, client IDs) are **never stored in source-controlled files**. The solution uses **User-Assigned Managed Identity** for all Azure service authentication at runtime and **DefaultAzureCredential** for Azure SQL connections — **eliminating the need for stored passwords** across all environments.

### Environment Variables (set by `azd` / `postprovision.ps1`)

These variables are required at provisioning time and automatically written to `.env` by `azd provision`:

| Variable                                   | Required    | Description                                              |

### .NET User Secrets (set by `postprovision.ps1`)

The post-provision hook calls `dotnet user-secrets set` for each project. The following tables show the exact secret keys used.

**`app.AppHost` (`app.AppHost/app.AppHost.csproj`):**

| Secret Key                             | Description                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏗️ `Azure:ResourceGroup`               | ☁️ Azure resource group name                         |
| 🔑 `Azure:TenantId`                    | 🔒 Azure AD tenant ID for `DefaultAzureCredential`   |
| 🆔 `Azure:ClientId`                    | 🆔 Managed Identity client ID (local dev only)       |
| 📊 `Azure:ApplicationInsights:Name`    | 📡 Application Insights resource name                |
| 📨 `Azure:ServiceBus:HostName`         | 🌐 Service Bus namespace hostname                    |
| 🔤 `Azure:ServiceBus:TopicName`        | 📨 Topic name (default: `ordersplaced`)              |
| 🔖 `Azure:ServiceBus:SubscriptionName` | 📬 Subscription name (default: `orderprocessingsub`) |

**`eShop.Orders.API` (`src/eShop.Orders.API/eShop.Orders.API.csproj`):**

| Secret Key                                 | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗄️ `ConnectionStrings:OrderDb`             | 💾 SQL Server connection string using AAD auth    |
| 📨 `ConnectionStrings:messaging`           | 🔌 Service Bus connection string (local emulator) |
| 📊 `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | 📡 Application Insights telemetry endpoint        |

**`eShop.Web.App` (`src/eShop.Web.App/eShop.Web.App.csproj`):**

| Secret Key                                 | Description                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 📊 `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | 📡 Application Insights telemetry endpoint |

### `appsettings.json` Configuration

**`app.AppHost/appsettings.json`** — controls Aspire orchestration behaviour:

```json
{
  "Azure": {
    "AllowResourceGroupCreation": false
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "Aspire.Hosting.Dcp": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

**`src/eShop.Orders.API/appsettings.json`** — Orders API HTTP client resilience settings:

```json
{
  "HttpClient": {
    "OrdersAPIService": {
      "Timeout": "00:02:00",
      "Resilience": {
        "AttemptTimeout": "00:00:30",
        "TotalRequestTimeout": "00:01:30",
        "Retry": {
          "MaxRetryAttempts": 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Azure SQL Connection String Format

The `OrderDb` connection string uses **Windows Integrated / AAD authentication** — no password required:

```text
Server=tcp:<sql-server-name>.database.windows.net,1433;
Initial Catalog=OrderDb;
Authentication=Active Directory Default;
Encrypt=True;
TrustServerCertificate=False;
Connection Timeout=30;
```

### Service Bus Configuration

The AppHost automatically switches between **local emulator mode** and **Azure mode** based on `Azure:ServiceBus:HostName`:

| Mode                | `HostName` value                     | Auth method                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥️ Local emulator   | `localhost` (default)                | 🔌 Emulator connection string                |
| ☁️ Azure deployment | `<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net` | 🔒 Managed Identity (DefaultAzureCredential) |

> [!NOTE]
> The `AllowResourceGroupCreation` flag in `app.AppHost/appsettings.json` is intentionally set to `false` to prevent accidental resource group creation during local development. Set it to `true` only when initializing a brand-new Azure environment for the first time with `azd env new`.

## Contributing

**Overview**

Contributions to the Azure Logic Apps Monitoring solution are welcome and encouraged. Whether you are fixing a bug, improving documentation, extending the Logic Apps workflows, or proposing new observability patterns, the project follows standard GitHub contribution conventions with an emphasis on clean, tested, and well-documented changes.

All pull requests are gated by the same automated test suite that runs during `azd provision` — so passing `dotnet test` locally before opening a PR is the most reliable way to ensure CI success. New features **should include test coverage** in the corresponding project under `src/tests/`.

**How to contribute:**

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Validate your workstation: `./hooks/check-dev-workstation.ps1`
3. Make your changes and run the full test suite:

   ```bash
   dotnet test --configuration Debug
   ```

4. **Ensure no placeholder text** (`TODO`, `TBD`, `Coming soon`) remains in your changes
5. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of the change

> [!TIP]
> Use the `Generate-Orders.ps1` hook script to generate realistic test data for end-to-end validation of workflow changes before submitting a pull request.
